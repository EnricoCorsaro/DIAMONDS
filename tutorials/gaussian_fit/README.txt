In this folder you can find the tutorial to run a gaussian fit in three different applications.
To run the Bayesian Inference test provided in this folder follow the following instructions:
2 - Open the GaussianFit.cpp file and use the compilation line provided on top (see Installation Guide for more information)
3 - The NSMC_configuringParameters files have to be renamed to NSMC_configuringParameters.txt each time a given application has to be executed.
4 - Execute the program via terminal in the same tutorials folder, making sure to match the dataset with the proper prior hyper parameters file. 
A set of output ASCII files containing the results will be stored in the same folder.
