1 - Move the files ending with *Model.h to /Diamonds/include/ and the files ending with *Model.cpp to /Diamonds/source/
2 - Move the remaining files of the folder to /Diamonds/demos/
3 - Open the BayesianInference*.cpp (one for each model included in the demo) files and use the compilation line provided on top (see Installation Guide for more information)
4 - Execute the program via terminal in the same demos folder. A set of output ASCII files containing the results will be stored in the same folder.
