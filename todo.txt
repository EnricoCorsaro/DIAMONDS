TODO
----

- likelihoodConstraint should be an argument of NestedSampler.drawWithConstraint() rather than a class variable.

- printToScreen should (everywhere) be replaced with a proper Logger functionality

- Header file inclusion should be kept to a minimum, so that the whole world is not recompiled when one of them changes.
