TODO
----

- likelihoodConstraint should be an argument of NestedSampler.drawWithConstraint() rather than a class variable.

- printToScreen should (everywhere) be replaced with a proper Logger functionality

- Header file inclusion should be kept to a minimum, so that the whole world is not recompiled when one of them changes.

- Avoid accessing the individual elements of Eigen arrays too often in UniformPrior::draw()

- Replace -DBL_MAX with numeric_limits<double>::lowest() defined in <limits>     (new in C++11)

- Replace X-means clusterer algorithm with something better

- The XXX.conrvativeResize(Ndimensions, Niterations + 1) statements at the beginning of the nested sampling loop in Multinest.run() are highly inefficient. Fix.

- Check if logLikelihood in NesteSampler is more efficiently described with a vector<double> than with a ArrayXd.

- NestedSampler contains a myriad of evidences: logMeanLiveEvidence, logMeanEvidence, logMeanEvidenceNew, logMeanTotalEvidence, ... Make it more clear. 

- Shouldn't the clustering part be really in MutliEllipsoid::drawWithConstraint() rather than in MultiNest.run()?

- In MultiNest.run() and elsewhere, consider replacing 'nestedSample' with 'liveSample'

- Update method docstrings in MultiEllipsoidSampler and NestedSampler (no longer up to date after refactoring)
